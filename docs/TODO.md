- [ ] 7. [Backend] Integrate a mocked or preliminary AI service for initial testing.
- [ ] 8. [Backend] Create Conversation Service: Manage conversation state and orchestrate calls between Comms Layer and AI Layer.
- [ ] 9. [API Gateway] Add routing for WebSocket connections and Conversation Service.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Client-side Development**
- [ ] 10. [Frontend] Scaffold React/Mobile client application.
- [ ] 11. [Frontend] Implement user authentication flow (login/register pages).
- [ ] 12. [Frontend] Implement real-time audio capture using AudioWorklet.
- [ ] 13. [Frontend] Implement WebSocket connection to the backend.
- [ ] 14. [Frontend] Implement audio streaming to the backend and playback of received audio.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization**
- [ ] 15. [Backend] Create History & Analytics Service: Implement asynchronous storage of conversations.
- [ ] 16. [Backend] Create Media Processing Service: Implement audio stream transcoding and storage to S3/OSS.
- [ ] 17. [AI Engine] Research and integrate production-ready streaming ASR/LLM/TTS services.
- [ ] 18. [Optimization] Performance testing and refinement of the end-to-end audio stream latency.
- [ ] [Backend] Complete API Endpoint Testing for User Service (Login, Update, etc.)
- [ ] [Docs] Update user_service/docs/schema.md documentation to align with the database table structure.

## Done
